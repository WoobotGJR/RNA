My Expo Pet-Project

Welcome to my pet project based on Expo (React Native)! This project was initially created by following a video course to learn the basics of React Native and has since been slightly reworked to include additional functionalities. It serves as a great example of building a feature-rich mobile application with a user-friendly interface.

    Video Watching: Stream and watch videos directly within the app.
    Search Queries: Integrated search functionality using API on Appwrite.

    Nativewind: Stylish and responsive UI built with CSS-in-JS technology.
